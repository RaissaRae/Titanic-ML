# Titanic-ML
This project was for a class during my third year at Thomas More called Cloud AI. I used a dataset from Kaggle.

## Project Goals
+ Clean and prepare real-world, messy tabular data
+ Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA)
+ Build multiple predictive models and compare their performance
+ Experiment with tools like AWS SageMaker and PyCaret
+ Develop a reusable data processing pipeline
+ Document and explain all steps for learning purposes

## Dataset
The dataset can be downloaded from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic/overview)
